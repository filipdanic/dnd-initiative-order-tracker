# dnd-initiative-order-tracker

A React.js app for keeping tracker of turn/initiative order in Dungeons and Dragons.

All of the code was developed during my [üî¥ Twitch live stream](https://www.twitch.tv/filipdanic). It‚Äôs posted in the [video section](https://www.twitch.tv/filipdanic/videos/all) as we as on my [üé• YouTube channel.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vhbo9Mloew&list=PLtzWdT8JUrMYWlSoXvs4E3SrSEn8W68xN)

You‚Äôre welcome to read the code and submit a PR with new features, bugfixes, or code quality improvements.

## Features

### Track Combatants and Roll a D20

Add all combatants to the list as cards. You can manually enter their initiative, or click on the D20 button to roll a die for them. You can also keep track of their health.

### Track Current Turn

To keep track of whose turn it is, just toggle between combatants with `ctrl+k` or `cmd+k` to switch highlighting.

### LocalStorage Sync

Everything is synced with the browser localStorage. If you close the tab and get back to it later, the turn order and all parameters will be saved.
